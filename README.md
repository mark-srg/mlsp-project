## MLSP - Project
### A deep learning toolbox for automatic segmentation of subcortical limbic structures from MRI images, Greve et al. (2021)
#### By Gatien Caillet & Marc-Andr√© Sergiel

#### Goals:

- Perform a sanity check on the evolution of the volumetry with respect to time (comparing sessions 1, 2 and 3 when available)
- Study the correlation with age, etc.


#### Project structure:
- `sclimbic_output`: folder that contains the outputs of the program for all the T1w images availables in the provided data folder 
- `Database.xlsx`: file that contains the subjetcts' data (age, MOCA score, etc.)
- `data_exploration.ipynb`: Python notebook on which we have run our experiments
